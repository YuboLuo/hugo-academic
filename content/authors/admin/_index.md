My name is Yubo Luo amd I am a Research Scientist at Meta. I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2023, advised by Dr. Shahriar Nirjon. My PhD research interest lied in the intersection of machine learning and embedded systems. My projects were mostly related to leveraging machine learning algorithms to improve system performance, e.g., energy consumption and time latency, especially on resource-constrained systems.

During my PhD Journey, I had three internships at Meta, Amazon and Nokia Bell Labs, respectively. Before that, I received my Master's degree from Tsinghua University in 2017 and Bachelor's degree from Central South University in 2014.
